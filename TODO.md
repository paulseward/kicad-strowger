# TODO:
* Meet ATW22001 (GPO diagrams standard): http://www.samhallas.co.uk/repository/po_docs/atw_22001.pdf
* Labels
  * positioning - does kicad allow custom labels for things like coil values?
  * Fix component numbering
* Check all pins are on a valid 25x25 grid - 50x50 is the default for kicad, but uniselectors would be huge
* Add battery/eth symbols
* How to handle u-points? I don't think we can do those with a symbol, might need to be advice about using labels
* Transformers and chokes
* redraw uniselectors with circles instead of an arc
* 10 position "small" version of the uniselector symbol
